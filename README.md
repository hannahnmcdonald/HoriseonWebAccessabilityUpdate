# HoriseonWebAccessabilityUpdate

This is a wepbpage for Horiseon Social Solution Services Inc, a company that needed a web page update in order that their site would be complicit with accessability standards. The site utilizes descriptions of various marketing tactics and benefits of services. 

Web accessability has become increasingly important today so that people with disabilities can still utilize web pages through screen readers, video captioning systems, braille keyboards and other assistive devices. 

Accessability is also very important for companies to increase their site traffic. Search engines like Google rank websites with better accessability higher than those without. Accessability also helps companies avoid litigation. 

With this project, I used an already function home page for Horiseon Social Solutions Services, to add semantic HTML elements to improve the function of the webpage and make the code more efficient. 

This project taught me many things about how to utilize code efficently and to serve more than one purpose by being as descriptive as possible instead of using vague elements. I believe my project stands out because I really broke down every line of code to try to make it as efficient as possible. It howevever, was challenging in some ways to edit the code so that the main structure of the site wasn't changed in the process. This project also taught me to use more semantic HTML from the beginning so in the future I won't have to edit my code too much.
